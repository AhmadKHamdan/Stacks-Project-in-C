Project Overview:
The project involves implementing a calculator system that utilizes stacks to process equations. It reads equations from an input file, checks their validity, converts valid equations from infix to prefix notation using stacks, evaluates the prefix expressions using stack-based algorithms, and provides various output options.

Functional Requirements:
Read Equations from File: The program should read equations from an input file provided by the user and store them using stack data structures.

Check Validity of Equations: It should check the validity of each equation by examining the arrangement of operands and operators, utilizing stack operations to ensure correct bracketing and operator placements.

Convert Equations to Prefix Notation: Convert valid equations from infix to prefix notation using stack-based algorithms to handle the conversion process efficiently.

Evaluate Prefix Expressions: Evaluate the prefix expressions using stack-based algorithms to perform arithmetic operations and compute the results of each equation.

Print Invalid Equations: Print all invalid equations from the input file, identifying any syntax errors or invalid arrangements of operands and operators.

Print to Output File: Print all information, including validity status, prefix expressions, and results, to an output file (output.txt) for further analysis or reference.

Exit Program: Provide an option to exit the program gracefully after completing the desired operations.
