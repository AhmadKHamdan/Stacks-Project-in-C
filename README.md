Project Overview:
The project involves implementing a calculator system that reads a number of equations from an input file to be evaluated. The equations are written in infix form, and the program should check the validity of the equations, convert valid equations from infix to prefix notation, evaluate the prefix expressions, and provide various output options.

Functional Requirements:
Read Equations from File: The program should read equations from an input file provided by the user.

Check Validity of Equations: It should check the validity of each equation and output whether each equation is valid or not.

Convert Equations to Prefix Notation: Convert valid equations from infix to prefix notation.

Evaluate Prefix Expressions: Evaluate the prefix expressions and print the results of each equation.

Print Invalid Equations: Print all invalid equations from the input file.

Print to Output File: Print all information to an output file (output.txt), indicating for each input equation if it is valid or not. For valid equations, print out the prefix expression and its result.

Exit Program: Provide an option to exit the program.
